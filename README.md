# Image_classifier
An image classification project that uses machine learning to classify images into predefined categories. This project demonstrates the power of computer vision techniques and deep learning for accurate image recognition.

Features
Model Architecture: Trained using [CNN/ResNet/etc.] for feature extraction and classification.
Dataset: Built and trained on [CIFAR-10/CIFAR-3/custom dataset].
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of [75%] on the test dataset.
Real-Time Testing: Can classify new images provided by the user.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas for data preprocessing and visualization.
OpenCV for real-time image testing (if applicable).
